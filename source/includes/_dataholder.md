# Data Holder

DataHolder **Object** describes the **Organization legally allowed to create, develop and publish data products.** 

*Data holder* means "a legal person, public body, international organisation, or a natural person who is not a data subject with respect to the specific data in question, which, in accordance with applicable Union or national law, has the right to grant access to or to share certain personal data or non-personal data." (Data Governance Act)

The *data holder* might not be the original IPR owner of the data used, but has rights operate with it. The contract or other agreement between Provider and possible data owner is not part of the standard as metadata or licence wise.

| <div style="width:150px">Element name</div>   | Type  | Options  | Description  |
|---|---|---|---|
| **dataHolder** | element | - | Binds the provider related business elements and attributes together |
| **en** | attribute | [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) defined 2-letter codes | This element binds together other product attributes and expresses the langugage used. In the example this is "en", which indicates that product details are in English. If you would like to use French details, then name the element "fr". The naming of this element follows options (language codes) listed in [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) standard. <br/><br/> You can have product details in multiple languages simply by adding similar sets like the example - just change the binding element name to matching language code. <br/><br/> The pattern to implement multilanguage support for data products was adopted from de facto UI translation practices. The attributes inside this element are commonly rendered in the UI for the consumer and providing a simple way to implement that was the driving reasoning.
